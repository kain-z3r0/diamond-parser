Thought for a few seconds


Understood. Below is the revised list—each component renamed where requested (e.g. **`GameFlowManager`** instead of `GameImportPipeline`)—with **five+ simple sentences** explaining **why** it’s that type and not another, including counter-examples.

---

## 1. `AppConfig`

**Type:** `@dataclass`
**Methods:**

* `@classmethod load_from_file(cls, path: str) → AppConfig`

**Why a dataclass?**

1. We only ever use `AppConfig` to hold data (paths, seeds, formats), never to encapsulate behavior.
2. A dataclass auto-generates `__init__`, `__repr__`, and `__eq__` so you don’t write boilerplate.
3. If it were a regular class, you’d need to write your own initializer just to store fields.
4. If it were an ABC, that would suggest subclasses and abstract methods, but we have none.
5. Using a dataclass makes the code self-documenting: “this is pure data, not logic.”

---

## 2. `FileManager`

**Type:** regular class
**Methods (instance):**

* `load_text(self, path: str) → str`
* `save_json(self, data: Any, path: str) → None`
* `update_yaml(self, data: Any, path: str) → None`

**Why a regular class?**

1. It groups together related file-I/O behaviors under one object that can carry configuration state (like a base directory).
2. If it were static-only (all `@staticmethod`), you couldn’t easily swap in different configurations at runtime.
3. If it were an ABC, you’d expect multiple implementations (e.g. `S3FileManager` vs `LocalFileManager`), which we don’t need yet.
4. If it were a Protocol, you’d lose the concrete methods we’re providing.
5. A regular class lets you extend later (e.g. add SFTP support) without pre-defining abstract methods.

---

## 3. `VersionManager`

**Type:** regular class
**Methods (instance):**

* `record_version(self, filepath: str) → None`
* `get_latest_version(self, filepath: str) → str`

**Why a regular class?**

1. It maintains internal state (e.g. a versions directory or policy) across calls.
2. If it were a dataclass, that implies no behavior, but here we have logic for stamping and retrieving versions.
3. If it were static methods only, you couldn’t preserve settings like “where to write the version files.”
4. If it were an ABC, it would force unnecessary subclassing before use—there’s only one implementation.
5. A regular class gives you the flexibility to evolve how versions are stored without changing the interface.

---

## 4. `UniqueIdGenerator`

**Type:** regular class
**Methods (static):**

* `@staticmethod generate_team_id(name: str) → str`
* `@staticmethod generate_player_id(name: str) → str`

**Why static methods here?**

1. ID generation logic doesn’t depend on per-instance mutable state once seeds are passed in.
2. Marking them static signals “we don’t touch `self`; this is pure computation.”
3. If they were instance methods, users might mistakenly think they alter object state.
4. If they were class methods, that implies you might override behavior at subclass level, which we don’t need.
5. Static methods live neatly on the class namespace without forcing instantiation just to call them.

---

## 5. `Transformer`

**Type:** `typing.Protocol`
**Signature:**

```python
class Transformer(Protocol):
    def transform(self, data: Any) -> Any: ...
```

**Why a Protocol?**

1. We only care that an object has a `transform()` method—we don’t want to force inheritance from a base class.
2. If it were an ABC, each transformer would have to `class X(Transformer)` and implement the abstract method; Protocol is lighter.
3. If it were a dataclass, it couldn’t define behavior.
4. A Protocol enables structural subtyping: any object with the right method fits, even third-party ones.
5. If it were a normal class, you’d accidentally inherit unwanted attributes.

---

## 6. `TeamTransformer`, `PlayerTransformer`, `EventTransformer`, `LineFilterTransformer`

**Type:** concrete classes implementing `Transformer`
**Methods (instance):**

* `transform(self, data: Any) → Any`

**Why instance methods?**

1. Each transformer may hold its own settings (e.g. staging\_dir, id\_generator).
2. If they were static, you’d have to pass all config on every call, making usage clumsy.
3. If they were class methods, that implies subclass overrides at the class level, which we don’t need.
4. If they inherited from a base class with logic, that would impose unnecessary structure.
5. An instance method tied to a small object keeps state and logic neatly bundled.

---

## 7. `Normalizer`

**Type:** regular class
**Methods (instance):**

* `add_step(self, step: Transformer) → None`
* `normalize(self, raw_text: str) → NormalizedLog`

**Why a regular class?**

1. It maintains a list of steps (transformers) that you build up at runtime.
2. If it were a dataclass, it wouldn’t handle behavior or dynamic lists.
3. If it were an ABC or Protocol, you’d lose the concrete orchestration logic.
4. If it were static, you couldn’t vary the pipeline per invocation or test different sequences.
5. A regular class with instance state lets you compose and reuse pipelines flexibly.

---

## 8. `NormalizedLog`

**Type:** `@dataclass`
**Fields:**

* `tokens: List[str]`
* `events: List[EventRecord]`
* `metadata: Dict[str, Any]`

**Why a dataclass?**

1. It’s purely a container for the parsed/normalized result.
2. Auto-generated methods save you from writing trivial code.
3. If it were a regular class, you’d write verbose constructors.
4. If it were frozen, you’d enforce immutability—which you might consider, but for now you want flexibility.
5. No behavior belongs here, so dataclass is ideal.

---

## 9. `Exporter`

**Type:** `abc.ABC`
**Methods:**

* `@abc.abstractmethod export(self, log: NormalizedLog, dest: str) → None`

**Why an abstract base class?**

1. We want a common interface (`export`) and possibly shared helper code for all exporters.
2. If it were a Protocol, you couldn’t include any shared base logic or default methods.
3. If it were a regular class, users might instantiate it directly, but it doesn’t make sense on its own.
4. An ABC prevents misuse by requiring subclass implementations.
5. It clearly signals “this is an abstract concept, not a concrete exporter.”

---

## 10. `JsonExporter`, `SqliteExporter`, `CsvExporter`, `ExcelExporter`

**Type:** concrete subclasses of `Exporter`
**Methods (instance):**

* `export(self, log: NormalizedLog, dest: str) → None`

**Why instance methods here?**

1. Each exporter might carry config (output directory, filename patterns).
2. If they were static, you’d have to pass too many parameters every time.
3. If they were class methods, you couldn’t hold per-instance settings.
4. If they inherited from a non-abstract base, you’d lose compile-time checks.
5. Instance methods on concrete exporters keep each format encapsulated with its own behavior.

---

## 11. `GameParser`

**Type:** regular class
**Methods (instance):**

* `register_exporter(self, name: str, exporter: Exporter) → None`
* `parse(self, log: NormalizedLog, formats: List[str]) → None`

**Why a regular class?**

1. It holds a dynamic registry (a dict) of named exporters.
2. If it were static, you couldn’t easily swap registries at runtime or test different sets.
3. If it were an ABC, you wouldn’t have a default registry implementation.
4. Instance-level state lets you register only the exporters you need.
5. This is the Registry Pattern: store and look up format handlers by name.

---

## 12. `GameFlowManager`

**Type:** regular class (Facade / Orchestrator)
**Methods (instance):**

* `run(self, source_path: str, outputs: List[str]) → None`

**Why a regular class here?**

1. It wraps the entire end-to-end flow in one object for simplicity.
2. If it were a static function, you’d sprinkle loading, normalizing, versioning, and parsing calls everywhere.
3. If it were an ABC or Protocol, that implies multiple implementations of the whole pipeline.
4. If it were a dataclass, that suggests only data, but here we orchestrate behavior.
5. As a Facade, it hides complexity behind `run()`, making the user’s code trivial.

### Design Patterns & OOP Concepts in Play

* **Dataclass vs. Regular Class**: use dataclass for pure data holders; regular class when you need behavior or state.
* **ABC vs. Protocol**: ABCs when you want abstract methods plus shared code; Protocols for structural typing without inheritance.
* **Static vs. Instance vs. Class Methods**: static for stateless utilities, instance for per-object behavior, classmethod for alternate constructors.
* **Single Responsibility**: each class has one clear job.
* **Composition & Registry Patterns**: `Normalizer` composes transformers; `GameParser` registers exporters.
* **Facade Pattern**: `GameFlowManager.run()` gives one simple entry point.

This structure uses OOP and design patterns judiciously—no over-engineering, but plenty of clear separation and flexibility.
